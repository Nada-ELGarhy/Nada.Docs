Report about Applied Data structures in problem solving

?	Applied Data structures in computer networking?
( MST, dijkstra)
 With networking since we are dealing with multiple nodes, we'd be using linked lists for keeping track of the links.
Graph data structure to determine shortest paths and optimal paths.
Queue data structure to maintain packets and remember their order of arrival.
Well in networking company almost all data structures are being used, some of them are followings
1. Stack
2. Queue
3. List
4. Tree 
5. Graph
?	Applied data structures in artificial intelligence (AI)?

One data structure that is used constantly in many search problems in Artificial Intelligence is the priority queue. This data structure is implemented usually with heaps. This data structure is particularly useful in the A* search algorithm, which is used to find shortest paths in graphs using admissible heuristics. The priority queue assigns each node with a weight and is used to determine the next node to check in the algorithm.
?	Applied Data structure is database?

lists and queues for parsing.
trees for parse trees and execution plans. The nodes in these trees are typically not of the same type, particularly for execution plans, which can make for adventures in debugging when things go wrong...
all manner of data structures (including stored ones such as B-Trees) in index structures.
hash tables, tries, and other in-memory "speed" structures for metadata (ie, table definitions and such things).
And more hash tables for lots of other things, such as lock managers, hash join structures, etc. And did I mention hash tables?
Some more specific to db engines are Pages and Rows, which are dynamic in their definitions and can't be completely stated as static structures in any programming language. In this sense, they're more like networking packets than more traditional data structures. Pages and Rows will be used in index structures and base table storage.
One aside: the vast majority of data structures in a database don't actually have anything to do with storage. They're for parsing, query optimization, query execution, concurrency, query scheduling, managing application connections, etc.

?	Applied Data structures in Problem solving

?	Linked List
-Linked list is a data structure which links each node to the next node. The developer can use linked list in the following use cases.
•	When the developer needs constant time for insertion and deletion.
•	When the data dynamically grows.
•	Do not access random elements from the linked list.
•	Insert the element in any position of the list.



?	Array
-The array is a data structure to store the same type of elements continuously. The developer can use an array in the following use cases.
•	Need access the elements using the index.
•	Know the size of the array before defining the memory.
•	Speed when iterating through all the elements in the sequence.
•	Array takes less memory compare than linked list.

?	Binary Search Tree
-A binary search tree is a tree data structure in which root node is less than or equal to left subtree and greater than or equal to right subtree. The developer can use Binary Search Tree in the following use cases.
•	Binary Search Trees are memory-efficient.
•	Use when the data need to be sorted.
•	Search can be done for a range of values.
•	Height balancing helps to reduce the running time.

?	Stack
-The stack is a last in, first out data structure. The developer can use the stack in the following use cases.
•	Expression evaluation and syntax parsing.
•	Finding the correct path in a maze using backtracking.
•	Runtime memory management.
•	Recursion function.
